ITAMAR, West Bank (AP) &mdash; A Palestinian attacker infiltrated a Jewish settlement on the West Bank early Saturday and killed five people, the Israeli military said.        

Israeli news media reported that the dead were members of the same family. The parents and three children &mdash; an 11-year-old, a 3-year-old and an infant &mdash; were stabbed in their sleep, the Web site YNet reported.        

The military said it was sweeping the area around Itamar, a religious settlement in the northern West Bank, and had set up checkpoints throughout the West Bank. Residents were instructed to stay in their homes.        

The overnight attack during the Jewish Sabbath was the first attack against settlers in months and the first of its kind and scope in years. It also comes as Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts are at a standstill and seems likely to complicate efforts to restart them.        

There was a similar attack in Itamar in 2002, when a gunman burst into the home of a family and killed a mother, three children and a security official.
