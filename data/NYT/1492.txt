BEIJING &mdash; Chinese security officers in a restive Tibetan area of Sichuan Province have released seven monks who were detained after one monk, Phuntsog, died after setting himself on fire to protest Chinese rule, according to a report issued late Thursday by International Campaign for Tibet, an advocacy group based in Washington.        

One of the seven monks released, Tashi, had head wounds that indicated he had been beaten while detained, the group said. An unknown number of monks and laypeople are still being detained.        

Security forces detained a large number of Tibetans in the town of Aba, known as Ngaba in Tibetan, when hundreds of locals held a protest on Wednesday after Phuntsog&rsquo;s set himself on fire to protest Chinese rule in the vast Tibetan regions of western China. It was the first time that a monk protesting against China had killed himself through self-immolation, according to historians of modern Tibet.        

Phuntsog, from Kirti Monastery, died early Thursday after fellow monks brought him to a hospital.        

Ngaba and Kirti Monastery were still under lockdown on Friday.
