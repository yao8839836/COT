The platform has since taken off in terms of usage, and today, TwitchTV is expanding to the iPhone.For background, TwitchTV features competitions of a variety of games and platforms with top gamers, tournaments and commentary. The platform aims to be a one-stop-shop for live video for eSports, which Justin.tv says is synonymous with competitive video gaming. TwitchTV features live video game battles and commentary from titles like Halo:Reach, Starcraft II, World Of Warcraft, Call Of Duty: Black Ops and others. With the new free iOS app, you can watch all of the content on the site. Users can watch videos in High Definition in full landscape mode; and browse by game, featured and more. You can also follow your favorite channels directly from the video stream, and see a list of the channels you follow that are broadcasting live. Plus, you can chat with your friends on the video stream via in-app chat. Considering the success of TwitchTV on web platforms, it should be interesting to see if the gaming site can build a base of users on mobile.
