The company also recently appointed Virendra Vase, a former Jigsaw (now a Salesforce company) executive, as its new COO.Zinio is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in NYC, London, Paris, Barcelona and Taipei.Last we heard Zinio raised funding was way back in 2005, when the company completed a $7 million growth financing round led by North Bridge Ventures and Commonwealth Capital, partly to finance an acquisition.Its unclear if they or which new investors participated in the recent $20 million funding round, but weve contacted the company for more information and will update when we hear back.
